Here are some handy hints for using emacs:

* General Help
  I found this site to be very helpful.  I think it comes in emacs,
  but the HTML version is great to bounce around in quickly.

** Kill & Yank - Cut & Paste
*** C-y
    Yank last killed text (yank). 
*** M-y
    Replace text just yanked with an earlier batch of killed text (yank-pop). 
*** M-w
    Save region as last killed text without actually killing it (kill-ring-save). 
*** C-M-w
    Append next kill to last batch of killed text (append-next-kill).

** Search And Replace
*** Temporarily exit query-replace mode with C-r and the resume with M-C-c

* Programming
** Make function and variable names easier to read: M-x glass-mode
** Parenthesis:
    C-M-f C-M-p (forward and backward)
    C-M-t (transpose, ala C-t)
** Guess what you're typing
    M-/
** Help building a regular expression
    M-x re-builder
** Spell Check
   Flyspell mode can make spelling much easier
   M-TAB auto-replaces a misspelled word under the cursor
   M-$ works everywere: spell check the word under the cursor


Local Variables:
mode: outline
End:
